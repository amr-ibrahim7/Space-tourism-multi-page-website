# Frontend Mentor - Space tourism

This is a solution to the [Space tourism multi-page website on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

### I added

- white overlay fills the screen when user click (explore)
- floating animation to destination planets
- dynamically changing page content (no multiple html pages)

### What I learned

- Page transitions
- Dealing with json files
- Changing page content dynamically using json
